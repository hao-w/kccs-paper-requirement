### Title: Amortized Population Gibbs Samplers with Neural Sufficient Statistics. [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.01382) 

**Advisor Statement** :  Hao designed methodology in the paper, which provides a new class of autoencoding variational methods for deep probabilistic models. In addition, he implemented all the experiments to evaluate the performace of this approach. As for submission, hao was responsible for drafting the write-up which was further edited by co-authors.
