This paper was accepted for **the 37th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), 2020** ([conference website](https://icml.cc/Conferences/2020/AcceptedPapersInitial)). The Acceptance Rate in 2020 is **21.8%**.


**Advisor Statement** :  Hao designed methodology in the paper, which provides a new class of autoencoding variational methods for deep probabilistic models. He also implemented all experiments that evaluate the performance of this approach. Finally, he took the lead in drafting this manuscript, which was further edited by co-authors.
